    	<h2>Parallel Categories:</h2>
        <h2>Correlation Between Voting Frequency, Education & Income in the U.S.</h2>
    	<iframe src="categories.html" title="Parallel Categories" width = "80%" height = "80%"

        <p>By looking at how each voter category splits to each of the three education levels, we can see that the largest portion 
            of the “Always” and “Sporadic” voters received a college degree. Conversely, the largest portion of voters who “Never” 
            vote had an education level of high school or less. The smallest group of “Never” voters are those who received a college
            degree, just as the smallest group of “Always” voters are those who had high school or less education. From these observations,
            it seems that voting frequency and education level are positively correlated. As for voting frequency and income, the majority 
            of “Always” voters were in the top two income brackets. The “Sporadic” voters are a bit more evenly distributed across the income 
            categories. Lastly, the largest individual group of the “Never” voters falls into the smallest income category, with the majority 
            overall being in the bottom two. Like voting frequency and education, voting frequency and income seem to be positively 
            correlated.</p>
        <p>Ignoring the voting category, it also seems that there is a positive correlation between education level and income category.
            The largest ribbons from the “College” education level go to the highest income category, and the largest ribbons from 
            the “High School or less” education level go to the lowest income bracket, while the “Some College” category 
            is fairly evenly distributed across all four income levels.</p>

        <h2>Voter Turnout and Absentee Voting Over Time in the United States</h2>

        <p>Overall, the 2016 and 2020 election years had a higher overall percentage of voter turnout for each locality than the 
            non-Presidential election years. 2018 is a little deceiving in that it has some points with over 100% voter turnout, 
            but that is due to the definition of active registered voters that is being used. The majority of the points in 2018 
            are lower than both 2016 and 2020. It makes sense that more voters would turn out for what is generally seen as a more 
            important election—the Presidential election.</p>
        <p>Additionally, 2020 looks particularly different from all the other years. In this year, there were much higher 
            percentages of absentee voters than the other years. This is due to the pandemic that broke out in the beginning of 
            that year, causing more voters to want to avoid crowds and germs.</p>

        <p>As we can see above, the northern parts of Virginia seem to overall have higher voter turnout percentages than the south. 
            There is also a notable difference between the eastern coast, which has higher turnout percentages, 
            versus the western part of the state with lower turnout percentages. Thus, the south-western region has 
            the lowest turnout percentages. It seems like the areas with the highest voter turnout percentages are those 
            that are more urban or suburban (which are those in Northern Virginia and along the coast) rather than rural; 
            this observation makes sense, as rural voters might have a harder time getting to their polling locations.</p>
