        <p>By looking at how each voter category splits to each of the three education levels, we can see that the largest portion 
            of the “Always” and “Sporadic” voters received a college degree. Conversely, the largest portion of voters who “Never” 
            vote had an education level of high school or less. The smallest group of “Never” voters are those who received a college
            degree, just as the smallest group of “Always” voters are those who had high school or less education. From these observations,
            it seems that voting frequency and education level are positively correlated. As for voting frequency and income, the majority 
            of “Always” voters were in the top two income brackets. The “Sporadic” voters are a bit more evenly distributed across the income 
            categories. Lastly, the largest individual group of the “Never” voters falls into the smallest income category, with the majority 
            overall being in the bottom two. Like voting frequency and education, voting frequency and income seem to be positively 
            correlated.</p>
        <p>Ignoring the voting category, it also seems that there is apositive correlation between education level and income category.
            The largest ribbons from the “College” education level go to the highest income category and the largest ribbons from 
            the “High School or less” education level go to the lowest income bracket while the “Some College” category 
            is fairly evenly distributed across all four income levels.</p>
